# odin-recipes
This is my first project.\
I will be using HTML that I have learnt in the last two days.\
I am going to make a home page which contains the links to the recipe pages and make recipe pages which contain an image of the food, its description, ingredients and steps of the recipe.\
I will be using elements such as <p> <h1> and use lists.
