        It is an easy and simple classical Indian dessert recipe made with chickpea flour pearls and the 
        goodness of sugar syrup. Basically, the Boondi Ladoo is a popular and easy alternative to the Motichoor Ladoo 
        which is easy and simple to make. The Boondi or the pearls are made with chickpea flour batter which is deep 
        fried till crisp. It is later mixed with sugar syrup to make it sticky and later shaped like round balls also 
        known as Laddu.
