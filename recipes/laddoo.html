    <p>
        It is an easy and simple classical Indian dessert recipe made with chickpea flour pearls and the 
        goodness of sugar syrup. Basically, the Boondi Ladoo is a popular and easy alternative to the Motichoor Ladoo 
        which is easy and simple to make. The Boondi or the pearls are made with chickpea flour batter which is deep 
        fried till crisp. It is later mixed with sugar syrup to make it sticky and later shaped like round balls also

    <ul>
        <h3>For Boondi:</h3>
        <li>2 cup besan</li>
        <li>pinch kesar food colour</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>¼ tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>oil, for frying</li>
        <h3>For Sugar Syrup:</h3>
        <li>1½ cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>¼ tsp kesar food colour</li>
        <li>½ tsp cardamom powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp pistachios</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Firstly, to prepare the boondi, in a large bowl take 2 cup besan, pinch kesar food colour and water.</li>
        <li>Whisk and mix well making sure there are no lumps in the batter.</li>
        <li>Further, add water slowly, and make smooth flowing consistency batter. If the batter is watery, then the boondi will turn flat. And if it is too thick, then the boondi will be formed with a tail.</li>
        <li>Also, add ¼ tsp baking soda and mix well.</li>
        <li>Boondi can be prepared using an oil strainer or small holes perforated spoon.</li>
        <li>Pour the prepared besan batter slowly, making sure the drops of besan fall into the oil.</li>
        <li>Do not overcrowd the boondis as they stick to each other. Stir gently.</li>
        <li>Once they are almost crisp, take off and drain over the kitchen paper towel.</li>
        <li>Prepare small boondi in batches and keep them aside.</li>
        <li>Now to prepare the sugar syrup, in a large kadai take 1.5 cup of sugar.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup water and boil for 2 minutes or until the sugar syrup turns sticky. Do not get string consistency sugar syrup.</li>
        <li>Further add ¼ tsp kesar food colour, ½ tsp cardamom powder and 1 tsp lemon juice. mix well.</li>
        <li>Now add in prepared boondi, 2 tbsp cashew and 2 tbsp pistachios. Mix until the sugar syrup is well coated.</li>
        <li>After some time, you can see the sugar syrup is absorbed by boondi. This makes boondi juicy.</li>
        <li>When the mixture is still lightly warm, start shaping the ladoo.</li>
        <li>Finally, Boondi Ladoo Recipe is ready to enjoy for up to 7 days when refrigerated.</li>
    </ol>
