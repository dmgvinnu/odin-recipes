    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions 
        such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, 
        but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.
