    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Andhra they call this upma 'Bombay rava' upma.
         It is extremely soft and spongy in texture.
          When I was a kid, I loved eating this upma as balls rolled in sugar.
        This upma makes an excellent accompaniment to pesarattu.<br>
    Upma, uppumavu, or uppittu is a dish of thick porridge from dry-roasted
     semolina or coarse rice flour. Upma originated from Southern India,
      is most common in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha,
       Karnataka, Maharashtra and Telangana.</p>
