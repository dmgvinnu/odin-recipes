    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        In Andhra they call this upma 'Bombay rava' upma.
        It is extremely soft and spongy in texture.
        When I was a kid, I loved eating this upma as balls rolled in sugar.
        This upma makes an excellent accompaniment to pesarattu.<br>
        Upma, uppumavu, or uppittu is a dish of thick porridge from dry-roasted
        semolina or coarse rice flour. Upma originated from Southern India,
        is most common in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha,
        Karnataka, Maharashtra and Telangana.

            <li>3 green chile peppers, sliced into thin rings</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh curry leaves</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 tomato, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups semolina (sooji rava)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li> Fry the dried red chile peppers, cashews, urad dal, chana dal, 
                and mustard seed in the hot oil until the cashews are golden brown, 
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Sprinkle the asafoetida powder into the skillet.</li>
            <li> Add the onion, green chile peppers, and curry leaves to the mixture</li>
            <li> cook and stir until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the water into the skillet along with the tomato, ginger, and salt</li>
            <li> bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour the semolina into the mixture in a thin stream, stirring continually. This is very important.</li>
            <li> If you add the semolina too quickly, or do not stir quick enough, you will get lumps.</li>
            <li> Cook and stir until the mixture begins bubbling</li>
            <li> reduce heat to low, cover, and allow to cook 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir the lime juice and ghee into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and allow to rest 10 minutes before serving.</li>   
        </ol>
